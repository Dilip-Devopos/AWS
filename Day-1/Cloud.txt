What is Cloud?

In the past, organizations would purchase physical servers and deploy their own applications on them. For example, let's say an organization named ABC bought 10 servers with 50 CPUs and 100 GB of RAM. Each server might run one or more applications that require 5 CPUs and 5 GB of RAM. The remaining resources would be unutilized or unused, leading to wasted money for the organization. To address this inefficiency, they began purchasing fewer physical servers and creating virtual machines on top of them using hypervisors. This way, resources were fully utilized, and the cost of servers was reduced. They also built their own network within the organization, known as a private cloud. External users, or those who are not part of the organization, cannot access these servers. This is what is referred to as the cloud.

Public and private Cloud?

When an organization creates its own servers and data center within the company, this is referred to as a private cloud. In contrast, a public cloud is a service provided by cloud providers. When users with accounts request servers, the cloud provider creates and provides virtual servers as needed.
In a private cloud, the organization must handle all aspects of data center management, including server maintenance, patch updates, and more. However, in a public cloud, the cloud provider takes care of these tasks, including maintenance, patch updates, and other responsibilities.

Eg:

Private Cloud: ABC Company creates and maintains its own cloud.
Public Cloud Providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, etc.

Why is Public Cloud so Popular?

Let's consider a startup company with around 100 employees. If they allocate some people to maintain server activities instead of focusing on development, it can be inefficient. When issues like upgrades or patch updates arise, they may spend a lot of time resolving them, which can negatively impact production. As mentioned earlier, public cloud providers offer many services that users can request and use as needed. There is no need to worry about maintenance, patch updates, or server downtime, as the cloud provider handles all these activities. This is why many startups and midsize companies prefer to use cloud providers instead of creating a private cloud.

Why AWS?

AWS (Amazon Web Services) was the first to enter the cloud market and has achieved significant success. AWS started with web services, which is why its naming convention reflects this. People who learn cloud platforms often choose AWS because it offers many services and is easily accessible through its user-friendly interface. Many companies also use AWS nowadays and prefer to hire people with strong knowledge of the AWS platform.
Although other cloud providers offer similar services, the naming conventions and user experiences are slightly different, but the underlying concepts are the same. Those who start with AWS tend to continue using its services because its ecosystem is very user-friendly. People generally prefer AWS first, followed by Azure and GCP (Google Cloud Platform).
